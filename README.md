# ASPNETCore-Prime
A little test bed for me to play around with ASP.NET Core, based around utilising a basic prime number checker.

It started with a simple Prime Service and Unit Test project thanks to this little [tutorial from Microsoft](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/articles/core/testing/unit-testing-with-dotnet-test) and grew from there.
